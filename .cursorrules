# Texas Hold'em Poker Game Development Rules

## Project Context

This is a real-time multiplayer Texas Hold'em poker game built with:

- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express + Socket.IO
- Game Logic: Custom poker engine with international tournament rules

## Development Philosophy (From: <https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2025/08/getting-good-results-from-claude-code/>)

### Core Beliefs

- **Incremental progress over big bangs** - Small changes that compile and pass tests
- **Learning from existing code** - Study and plan before implementing
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic** - Adapt to project reality
- **Clear intent over clever code** - Be boring and obvious

### Simplicity Means

- Single responsibility per function/class
- Avoid premature abstractions
- No clever tricks - choose the boring solution
- If you need to explain it, it's too complex

## Development Process

### 1. Running the Application

**CRITICAL**: Always use proper npm scripts for development:

- **Server**: Use `npm run dev` (utilizes nodemon for auto-restart)
- **Client**: Use `npm run dev` (utilizes Vite with hot module replacement)
- **Never use**: `node server.js` or direct file execution during development
- **Benefits**: Real-time code updates, automatic restart, proper development environment

**Correct Commands**:

```bash
# Start server (in server/ directory)
cd server && npm run dev

# Start client (in client/ directory) 
cd client && npm run dev
```

### 2. Planning & Staging

Break complex work into 3-5 stages. Document in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
## Stage N: [Name]
**Goal**: [Specific deliverable]
**Success Criteria**: [Testable outcomes]
**Tests**: [Specific test cases]
**Status**: [Not Started|In Progress|Complete]
```

- Update status as you progress
- Remove file when all stages are done

### 2. Implementation Flow

1. **Understand** - Study existing patterns in codebase
2. **Test** - Write test first (red)
3. **Implement** - Minimal code to pass (green)
4. **Refactor** - Clean up with tests passing
5. **Commit** - With clear message linking to plan

### 3. When Stuck (After 3 Attempts)

**CRITICAL**: Maximum 3 attempts per issue, then STOP.

1. **Document what failed**:
   - What you tried
   - Specific error messages
   - Why you think it failed

2. **Research alternatives**:
   - Find 2-3 similar implementations
   - Note different approaches used

3. **Question fundamentals**:
   - Is this the right abstraction level?
   - Can this be split into smaller problems?
   - Is there a simpler approach entirely?

4. **Try different angle**:
   - Different library/framework feature?
   - Different architectural pattern?
   - Remove abstraction instead of adding?

## Technical Standards

### Architecture Principles

- **Composition over inheritance** - Use dependency injection
- **Interfaces over singletons** - Enable testing and flexibility
- **Explicit over implicit** - Clear data flow and dependencies
- **Test-driven when possible** - Never disable tests, fix them

### Code Quality

- **Every commit must**:
  - Compile successfully
  - Pass all existing tests
  - Include tests for new functionality
  - Follow project formatting/linting

- **Before committing**:
  - Run formatters/linters
  - Self-review changes
  - Ensure commit message explains "why"

### Error Handling

- Fail fast with descriptive messages
- Include context for debugging
- Handle errors at appropriate level
- Never silently swallow exceptions

## Decision Framework

When multiple valid approaches exist, choose based on:

1. **Testability** - Can I easily test this?
2. **Readability** - Will someone understand this in 6 months?
3. **Consistency** - Does this match project patterns?
4. **Simplicity** - Is this the simplest solution that works?
5. **Reversibility** - How hard to change later?

## Code Style & Standards

- Use modern ES6+ JavaScript/JSX syntax
- Follow React functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (avoid inline styles when possible)
- Maintain consistent file naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- Add meaningful comments for complex game logic

## Game-Specific Rules

- All poker logic must follow international Texas Hold'em tournament standards
- Use professional poker terminology in Chinese (弃牌, 跟注, 加注, 梭哈, etc.)
- Betting increments must align with big blind values
- All-in scenarios must be handled correctly (no additional betting when all players are all-in)
- Maintain proper pot calculation and side pot logic

## UI/UX Guidelines

- Prioritize game table visibility over UI elements
- Keep action buttons compact and professional
- Use consistent color schemes:
  - Red: Fold actions
  - Green: Check actions  
  - Blue: Call actions
  - Yellow: Raise actions
  - Purple: All-in actions
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

## Project Integration

### Learning the Codebase

- Find 3 similar features/components
- Identify common patterns and conventions
- Use same libraries/utilities when possible
- Follow existing test patterns

### Tooling

- Use project's existing build system
- Use project's test framework
- Use project's formatter/linter settings
- Don't introduce new tools without strong justification

## Quality Gates

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No linter/formatter warnings
- [ ] Commit messages are clear
- [ ] Implementation matches plan
- [ ] No TODOs without issue numbers

### Test Guidelines

- Test behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per test when possible
- Clear test names describing scenario
- Use existing test utilities/helpers
- Tests should be deterministic

## Development Workflow

- Test all betting scenarios thoroughly
- Log important game state changes for debugging
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing saves/sessions
- Use descriptive variable names for game states

## Communication Style

- Explain complex poker logic changes clearly
- Provide before/after comparisons for UI changes
- Include testing instructions for new features
- Use Chinese for user-facing text, English for code comments

## File Organization

- Components in `/client/src/components/`
- Game logic in `/server/gameLogic/`
- Shared utilities in appropriate folders
- Keep related files grouped together

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize unnecessary re-renders in React components
- Optimize socket communication
- Handle network disconnections gracefully
- Cache frequently accessed game data

## Error Handling

- Provide user-friendly error messages in Chinese
- Log detailed errors for debugging
- Implement fallback states for network issues
- Validate all user inputs

## Important Reminders

### NEVER

- Use `--no-verify` to bypass commit hooks
- Disable tests instead of fixing them
- Commit code that doesn't compile
- Make assumptions - verify with existing code

### ALWAYS

- Commit working code incrementally
- Update plan documentation as you go
- Learn from existing implementations
- Stop after 3 failed attempts and reassess

## When Making Changes

1. Consider impact on existing game sessions
2. Test with multiple players
3. Verify mobile compatibility
4. Check console for errors/warnings
5. Ensure proper state synchronization between client/server
